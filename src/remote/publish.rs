//! The v8 Publisher: turns owner-state changes into session push events without ever
//! touching the reducer.
//!
//! Both owner hosts call [`Publisher::observe`] after turns that can change a projected
//! facet, on the owner-loop thread next to their existing `media.publish(..)` observers,
//! passing a [`CoreView`] borrow of current state. Ordinary position/cache clocks bypass
//! the view entirely because elapsed is deliberately not pushed. Change detection is
//! fingerprint-based; models are built and serialized only when something changed AND
//! someone is subscribed, and the serialized payload fans out by `Arc` (the per-session
//! envelope is spliced at write time by the session writer).
//!
//! Frozen rule: the 1 Hz `PlayerTimePos` tick while
//! playing changes only `elapsed_ms`, which is deliberately **outside** the player
//! fingerprint — a time-tick turn emits nothing, ever. Clients interpolate.
//!
//! Architecture rule: this module reads core state only through [`CoreView`] — reducer
//! message types stay out of `src/remote` entirely (`scripts/check-architecture.sh`
//! enforces that boundary).
